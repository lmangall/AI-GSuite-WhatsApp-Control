# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates LangChain.js into the existing NestJS WhatsApp AI control application to enhance AI agent capabilities with advanced prompt engineering, memory management, and tool orchestration. The integration will replace or augment the current BaseAgentService architecture while maintaining compatibility with existing hosted MCP servers (accessed through the MCP wrapper) and WhatsApp webhook functionality. Additionally, this will enable integration of the currently unused Brave web search module.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate LangChain.js into the agent architecture, so that I can leverage advanced AI orchestration capabilities and standardized tool interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize LangChain.js with proper configuration for both Gemini and OpenAI models
2. WHEN a WhatsApp message is received THEN the system SHALL process it through LangChain.js agents instead of the current BaseAgentService
3. WHEN LangChain agents are created THEN they SHALL maintain compatibility with existing hosted MCP servers through the MCP wrapper service
4. IF LangChain initialization fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to the existing agent implementation
5. WHEN using LangChain agents THEN the system SHALL preserve all current functionality including tool calling and response formatting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced conversation memory and context management, so that the AI can maintain better continuity across multiple WhatsApp interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends multiple messages THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context using LangChain memory components
2. WHEN conversation history exceeds token limits THEN the system SHALL intelligently summarize or truncate context
3. WHEN a new conversation starts THEN the system SHALL initialize fresh memory while optionally preserving user preferences
4. WHEN memory operations fail THEN the system SHALL continue processing without breaking the conversation flow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use LangChain's tool integration patterns, so that MCP servers can be more easily managed and extended with additional capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hosted MCP servers are available through the wrapper THEN the system SHALL expose them as LangChain tools with proper schemas
2. WHEN new hosted MCP servers are configured THEN they SHALL be automatically discoverable by LangChain agents
3. WHEN tool execution occurs THEN LangChain SHALL handle error management and retry logic
4. WHEN tools return results THEN LangChain SHALL format them appropriately for WhatsApp responses
5. IF MCP tool execution fails THEN LangChain SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement advanced prompt engineering capabilities, so that I can create more sophisticated AI behaviors and response patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing user messages THEN the system SHALL use LangChain prompt templates for consistent formatting
2. WHEN different conversation contexts occur THEN the system SHALL select appropriate prompt strategies
3. WHEN system prompts need updates THEN they SHALL be configurable through LangChain prompt management
4. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL use LangChain output parsers for structured formatting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to have web search capabilities through the existing Brave search module, so that it can provide current information and answer questions requiring real-time data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks questions requiring current information THEN the system SHALL use the Brave web search module through LangChain tools
2. WHEN web search is needed THEN LangChain SHALL automatically determine when to trigger search based on query context
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN LangChain SHALL synthesize them into coherent responses for WhatsApp
4. WHEN search fails or returns no results THEN the system SHALL gracefully inform the user and continue with available knowledge
5. WHEN search queries are made THEN they SHALL be optimized and filtered for relevance before sending to Brave API

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the LangChain integration to be configurable and maintainable, so that I can adjust AI behavior without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN LangChain configuration SHALL be loaded from environment variables or config files
2. WHEN LangChain settings change THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading without full restart
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN LangChain SHALL provide comprehensive logging and tracing capabilities
4. WHEN performance monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL expose LangChain metrics and usage statistics
